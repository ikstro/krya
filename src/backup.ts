// A backup of what the person made in Krya, one file to keep or to take to
// another computer (Settings › Backup): the settings, the word notebook, the
// mistakes, what Krya learned from their typing (the words, never the
// fingerprints, which are salted on this computer), the recent translations,
// the dictated phrases and the talks with the duck put away. Not in it: the downloads (they download again),
// the speech engine's settings with the Hugging Face key (a secret), the
// transcripts (their own folder), this computer's measurements. Importing
// replaces the settings and adds the rest to what is here, so nothing here is
// lost. A settings file exported by 0.10.0–0.10.1 (the settings alone) imports too.
