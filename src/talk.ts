// One talk with the duck, held by the main process while Krya runs (the page
// only draws it). The person's line is checked (Check my English: its mistakes
// marked in place, a note in their own language) and answered by the duck
// (duck.ts) at once, both on the same model, so the marks come in about a
// second and the answer in about three. The answer keeps to what was said,
// mistakes and all. A new line while the duck still thinks takes its place:
// the answer under way is dropped, the check is not. talks.ts keeps it on
// disk, so it goes on after Krya starts again; New talk puts it away there.
